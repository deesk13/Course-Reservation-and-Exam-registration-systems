# Use case Diagrams
A use case is a methodology used in system analysis to identify, clarify, and organize system requirements. The use case is made up of a set of possible sequences of interactions between systems and users in a particular environment and related to a particular goal. It is represented using ellipse. Actor is any external entity that makes use of the system being modeled.

# Sequence Diagram
A sequence diagram in Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a kind of interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.

# Activity Diagram
An activity diagram is a variation or special case of a state machine in which the states or activity representing the performance of operation and transitions are triggered by the completion of operation. The purpose is to provide view of close and what is going on inside a use case or among several classes. An activity is shown as rounded box containing the name of operation.

# Package Diagram
A package diagram is represented as a folder shown as a large rectangle with a top attached to its upper left corner. A package may contain both sub ordinate package and ordinary model elements. All uml models and diagrams are organized into package. A package diagram in unified modeling language that depicts the dependencies between the packages that make up a model. A Package Diagram (PD) shows a grouping of elements in the OO model, and is a Cradle extension to UML PDs can be used to show groups of classes in Class Diagrams (CDs), groups of components or processes in Component Diagrams (CPDs), or groups of processors in Deployment Diagrams (DPDs). There are three types of layer. They are 1.User interface layer 2.Domain layer 3.Technical services layer

## class diagram:
A class is drawn as rectangle box with three compartments or components separated by horizontal lines. The top compartment holds the class name and middle compartment holds the attribute and bottom compartment holds list of operations.
